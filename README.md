## If you somehow found this repo read this first
This repository is just a meme repo, I simply tried to mimic the moroccan salutations but using a custom network protocol built on top of TCP, so the point is to prove how inefficient the morrocan salutations are XD!

## Context
Example of every moroccan salutation ( especially with relatives ):
* Me : Hello! ( Salamoalikom )
* My Uncle : Hey man how are you doing ?
* Me : I'm fine thank you, how are you doing ?
* My Uncle : How is life ?
* Me : I'm fine !
* My Uncle ( without caring that I said "I'm fine" twice already ): How are you man!
* Me : I swear I'm FINE!
* My Uncle : How's everything going?
* Me : :< 
* My Uncle : How have you been lately?
* My Uncle : How are you feeling today?
* Me : >:( 

as I've been moroccan for quite a while now, I felt that was like a sort of protocol where the server ( the uncle ) just keeps checking on the client, until he's bored, or the ram is full.
